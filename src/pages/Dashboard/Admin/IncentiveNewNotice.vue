            Incentives to agricultural production are continuously changing in
            response to shifts in both agricultural policies and agricultural
            prices. These shifts impact the production and consumption choices
            made by farmers and consumers, which in turn impact hunger and
            malnutrition, change labor markets, and shape the global picture on
            climate change. Historically, updated information and data on
            agricultural incentives has been widely scattered and largely
            inaccessible on a global scale. The Ag Incentives Consortium aims to
            change this by bringing together key international organizations to
            provide comparable incentives data in a single location.
