### Developing an e-enabled real time produce life cycle monitoring & sharing mechanism to enhance output realization to farmers through private sector participation and DBT - PK414

Develop a portal for farmer registration along with farm plan. This plan should help government agencies to monitor the life cycle crop across life cycle. In case the production fails then provide facility to report that too. Due to information asymmetry across producers and buyers there emerges a situation of distress sales, this solution may be a step to address this arbitrage situation. Additionally provide them with advisory of different activities during the farm schedule. This kind of plan helps government to plan the production and procurement plan, thereby increasing invome of farmers. If there are too many farmers producing same crop they can be recommended/incentivised to produce some other crop.

### Developing a system or solution to provide a customized and precise land parcel specific fertilizer and input usage plan to reduce cost and maximize returns for the farmers - PK417

Develop a system or solution to provide a customized and precise land parcel specific fertilizer and input usage plan to reduce cost and maximize returns for the farmers. Analyse the right parameters use them precisely to reduce costs if production. To achieve this simulate the fertilizer application to land and identify the precise parameters for the purpose.

### Estimation of crop yield using modern ICT tools which is quick and reliable for making a realistic plan for procurement and to compensate farmers for yield loss if any. - PK409

Current methods for estimating crop yield take months in crop cutting experiments and farmers have to wait for months to get compensated in case of loss etc. Solution for estimating crop yield using modern ICT technologies needs to be developed, which will make realistic plan for procurement. This would also help in compensate farmers in case of yield loss. The solution needs to be quick and reliable.
